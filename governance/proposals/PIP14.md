The PeopleDAO Accounteing Team is an essential part of PeopleDAO operations. Part of the teamâ€™s duties is to address the ever-increasing demand for accounting and reward payout issues, and assist in enlightening members on the proper use of platforms used for payment. One of our successes in the just concluded Season 1 of PeopleDAO was ensuring that all the Teams in PeopleDAO which had accounting and Coordinape issues fixed and we look forward to continuing this in all the subsequent seasons. The Accounting team is also tasked with providing payout information and making the spreadsheet links available and accessible to everyone. This task also involves updating total $GIVE token allocated during each epoch in Coordinape into the spreadsheet.

Just like accounting is absolutely needed in every organisation, it is also very vital in this space as well. Along with providing accounting help, the team will also facilitate and provide tutorials on how to use reward distribution platforms in web3 such as Coordinape, Dework and etc. The Accounting team will provide a weekly calendar that will include plans, meetings and tasks for each week. So we urge you to vote for the Accounting team budget proposal to officially make us a Team as this guarantees detailed and all-inclusive accounting.

The Accounting Team request a total of 198,000 $PEOPLE token in funding for its season 2 operations.

Core proposal  
Author: Tet#7609  
Reviewer: 0xAA#2040  
Required Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if not exceeds the Quorum, the proposal will need exceeds 90% of the votes to pass)  
Vote Duration: 5 days

PeopleDAOâ€™s governance token, $PEOPLE, is native to the Ethereum mainnet. All along, we have designed the PeopleDAO Snapshot Space to enable voting as long as users hold $PEOPLE token from the Ethereum mainnet. However, Binance has recently deployed their bridged version of the $PEOPLE token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This newly established bridge has a token standard of BEP-20.

This proposal aims to amend the PeopleDAO Snapshot Space to include the holders of $PEOPLE from the BSC during proposal voting. With this, holders of both $PEOPLE token on both Ethereum mainnet and Binance Smart Chain are able to vote with no one missing out.

The contract address for the bridged $PEOPLE token can be found [here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x2c44b726adf1963ca47af88b284c06f30380fc78). At the time of writing, there are more than 300 holders of $PEOPLE on BSC.

Choice 1. Yes, Include BSC $PEOPLE  
Choice 2. No, Do Not Include BSC $PEOPLE

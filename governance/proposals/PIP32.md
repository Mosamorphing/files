# PIP32: PeopleDAO Multisig Governor Election 2023 (PeopleDAO 多签选举 2023)

Final Round of the PeopleDAO Multisig Governor Election

Dear $PEOPLE,

PeopleDAO have come a long way over the past year ever since our first formal establishment of the community Treasury since 17th January 2022. As we say goodbye to the current Governor lineup who have served the DAO since the inception of the Treasury, we would like to welcome the new soon-to-be Governors lineup in this final round of Multisig Election.

We are going to elect 9 (NINE) Multisig Governors de novo in this final round from our pool of 15 self-nominated candidates who have been chosen by the community in our preliminary round of voting on our community Discord server.

The criterions are as such:

- A multisig Governor shall be able to comprehend and use the basic functions in the Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) to sign and approve transactions.
- A multisig Governor shall be able to dedicate reasonable amount of time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the role, these mainly include: participate in necessary meetings, verify and sign transactions based on democratic resolutions of People DAO.
- A multisig Governor shall exercise due diligence to safeguard his/her own key through any reasonable means. Although the multisig is designed to protect assets even in case of compromises on parts of the signers, each Governor still need to act responsibly.
- Outside Candidates (those not originally from the PeopleDAO) who are $PEOPLE token holders are welcomed, provided they act in good faith and are able to fulfill the above mentioned requirements.
- The service term for our multisig Governor will be determined by a community vote on Snapshot in the upcoming PeopleDAO Improvement Proposal 33 (ie. PIP33).
- Monthly remuneration of the multisig Governors will be determined by the Operations Team (Ops Team) of PeopleDAO in their seasonal budget proposals. The Governors will be rewarded a minimum of 1,000 $PEOPLE tokens per month, subject to increment depending on the Ops Team's budget allowance and needs.

Details on our 15 candidates can be found in the following link. Top 9 voted candidates will be our multisig Governor.

PeopleDAO 最后一轮的多签选举

亲爱的$PEOPLE，

自 2022 年 1 月 17 日我们首次正式成立社区财政部以来，PeopleDAO 在过去的一年里取得了长足的进步。当我们告别自财政部成立以来一直为 DAO 服务的现任总督阵容时，我们想欢迎新的即将成为最后一轮多签人选举的阵容。

在最后一轮中，我们将从我们社区 Discord 服务器上的初步投票中选出的 15 名自荐候选人中选出 9 名多签人。

多签人标准如下：

- 多签监管者应能够理解和使用 Safe（以前称为 Gnosis Safe）中的基本功能来签署和批准交易。
- 多签监管者应能够投入合理的时间来履行角色的职责和责任，这些主要包括：参加必要的会议，根据 PeopleDAO 的民主决议验证和签署交易。
- 多签监管者应尽职尽责地通过任何合理的方式保护他/她自己的密钥。 尽管多签名旨在保护资产，即使在部分签名者妥协的情况下，每个多签人仍然需要负责任地行事。
- 欢迎持有 $PEOPLE 代币的外部候选人（并非最初来自 PeopleDAO 的候选人），前提是他们诚信行事并能够满足上述要求。
- 我们多签人的服务期限将由社区在即将到来的 PeopleDAO 改进提案 33（ PIP33）中对 Snapshot 进行投票来确定。
- 多签理事的月薪将由 PeopleDAO 的运营团队（Ops Team）在其季节性预算提案中确定。 多签人每月将获得至少 1,000 个 ¥PEOPLE 代币奖励，具体奖励金额取决于 Ops 团队的预算津贴和需求。

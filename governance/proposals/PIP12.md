The Design Team of PeopleDAO is the DAO’s foundation in art and design. Previously having worked on select NFT projects for the DAO and creation and coordination of POAPs, it is now moving towards crafting different aspects of PeopleDAO that involve having an established branding design identity.

During Season 1, the Design Team worked on the NFT projects “For the People” and Nicholas Cage PFPs. It also worked on POAP matters: creating art and POAP events, maintaining a good relationship with the official POAP team, and most importantly, providing incentive and recognizing the meaningful contributions of the individuals within the DAO. For Season 2, the Design Team is broadening its horizons with new design initiatives and publicity materials.

For Season 2, the PeopleDAO Design Team will work on having a solid branding identity for PeopleDAO. It will have its own brandbook, consistent social media templates, designs, and infographic releases. With these, the Design Team aims to increase awareness of PeopleDAO, strengthen our presence in social media, and brand us as a DAO that is credible and informational: providing insight on crypto, DeFi, and social goods. Additionally, the Design Team will also continue to reinforce positive and meaningful contributions through its POAP efforts, as it works on a new system of rewarding, and a need for a POAP Monitor. Since we also anticipate more design work in the season, following the introduction of Incubated Projects, we have also included a Discretionary Fund for this season.

With this, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 2. (Link to sheets if image does not work: [Attachment 1](./PIP12-attachment1.pdf))

Thank you, and Long Live PeopleDAO!

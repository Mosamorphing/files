PIP42: Change from Incubator to Accelerator  
Author: MatterTurbulent#5161  
Required Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if votes don’t reach the quorum, the proposal will need to exceed 90% approval to pass).  
Vote Duration: 5 days

Since its founding, PeopleDAO has defined itself as a platform for launching social impact projects. We formalized this operation (and Team) within the DAO during July last year and our portfolio has grown to include six projects. We originally conceived our program as an incubator, supporting entrepreneurs in turning their ideas into reality. Yet, with each business quarter our program reflected on what’s working, what’s not, and prescribed adjustments:

- [Report 1](https://github.com/People-DAO/files/blob/main/incubator/presentations/PeopleDAO-incubator-v1-evaluation.pdf)
- [Report 2](https://github.com/People-DAO/files/blob/main/incubator/presentations/PeopleDAO-incubator-v2-evaluation.pdf)

After over 6 months of activity as an Incubator, the Team has decided to evolve into an Accelerator. The primary distinction is that we’ll now only accept projects who have existing prototypes, proof-of-concept, or the equivalent. There is a saying: one day in the real world is a year in crypto. We are a relatively small DAO and supporting projects from the ideation stage has proven too resource and time-intensive, limiting our ability to take on a bigger portfolio amidst rapidly emerging trends. We are excited for our new direction as an Accelerator and welcome developers and builders to leverage our seed funding, marketing reach, and in-house services.

We are holding this vote to officiate changing the Incubator Program into the Accelerator Program, and therefore change the Incubator Team into the Accelerating Team.

Should the voters approve, we encourage the DAO to adopt a new organizational tagline: “Accelerating People,” representing our dedication to social impact, and honoring our namesake token.

Vote Yes to APPROVE the change from Incubator to Accelerator  
Vote No to REJECT the change from Incubator to Accelerator

PIP42：从孵化器到加速器的转变  
作者: MatterTurbulent#5161  
要求的法定人数: 100M$PEOPLE（如果投票没有达到法定人数，提案需要超过 90%的支持率才能通过).  
投票时间: 5 天

自成立以来，PeopleDAO 已将自己定义为一个启动社会影响项目的平台。去年 7 月，我们在 DAO 中正式确定了这一业务（和团队），而我们的投资组合已经发展到包括 六个项目. 我们最初设想我们的项目是一个孵化器，支持企业家把他们的想法变成现实。然而，每一个商业季度，我们的项目都会反思哪些是有效的，哪些是无效的，并作出调整 (报告 1,报告 2).

经过 6 个多月的孵化器活动，团队决定发展成为一个加速器。主要的区别是，我们现在只接受有现有原型的项目，概念验证，或类似的项目。有句话说：现实世界的一天就是加密货币的一年。我们是一个相对较小的 DAO，事实证明，从构思阶段就开始支持项目，资源和时间都很密集，限制了我们在迅速出现的趋势中承担更大的投资组合的能力. 我们对我们作为加速器的新方向感到兴奋，并欢迎开发者和建设者利用我们的种子资金, 营销范围和内部服务.

我们举行这次投票是为了主持将孵化器项目改为加速器项目，从而将孵化器团队改为加速器团队.

如果选民批准，我们鼓励 DAO 采用一个新的组织标语。"加速 People"，代表我们对社会影响的贡献，并纪念我们的同名代币.

赞成将 "孵化器 "改为 "加速器".  
否决将 "孵化器 "改为 "加速器".

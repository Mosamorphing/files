PeopleDAO Marketing Team aims to promote PeopleDAO and $PEOPLE ecosystems for public good. We successfully conducted a meme contest, a mini quiz (Galxe OAT Campaign) to test and spread knowledge about what our DAO is, and also a Marketing Video for PeopleDAO Season 2 Achievements Recap.

In the PeopleDAO Season 4, the marketing team will further conduct more exciting events “For the People” along with various partnerships and videos to spread the value of PeopleDAO, engage in a more frequent Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and TikTok posts and engagements/giveaways,

The marketing team will also work closely with the incubator team, support with funds and most importantly support with marketing for incubated projects.

Also plan to implement a game event that will be held right inside our discord server weekly, prizes to be earned tagged along with other surprises.

- Host 2 AMAs or Twitter Spaces
- 2 new collaborations/partnerships
- 4 marketing video
- 1 News/Press connection

The Design Team of PeopleDAO is the DAO's artistic and design basis. Having previously focused on developing uniform DAO iconography via social media design and website rebranding, as well as the creation of contributor POAPs, it has now achieved its aim of designing various areas of PeopleDAO that need a branded design identity.

During Season 2, the Design Team focused on branding by producing and assembling the Brand Book, creating social media design templates for use by the DAO, and redesigning our website with the assistance of our Dev team. It was also responsible for POAP affairs, including the creation of POAP events, the maintenance of a positive connection with the official POAP team, and, most importantly, offering incentives and acknowledging the significant efforts of DAO members. The Design Team is expanding its horizons for Season 3 with the addition of new members and PeopleDAO anniversary design efforts.

For Season 3, the PeopleDAO Design Team will continue working on the website by adding new designs through the use of elements that were previously made in Season 2. Some of the new website pages envisioned to be accomplished include the (i) publishing module - lists all publications (e.g., articles, blog posts, etc.) produced by the DAO from sources like Mirror, Notion, and other platforms; (ii) project profiles - describes the purpose and mission of each incubation project, and provides information about each projectâ€™s team members, external links, and more; and (iii) token profile - display the history, properties, and statistics about the $PEOPLE token. Additionally, the crafting of infographics and other content-rich publicity and promotional materials will also be continued for.

Regarding new jobs, the POAP Lead role has been promoted to Co-Lead; this role will include overseeing additional shared design activities with the Design Team Lead. This requires participation in Fireside chat sessions, POAP-related activities, and collaboration with the POAP Assistant. In addition, we are raising the Season 2 POAP Monitor post to the far more aggressive POAP Assistant position. They will work closely with the Co-Lead to manage POAP operations, including monitoring people who qualify for our new POAP award system and attending Fireside chat if none of the Leads are available.

Due to the approaching PeopleDAO Anniversary, the Design Team has additionally allocated an expected budget breakdown for the event's design and promotional materials. This includes social media postings, POAPs, and additional money for discretionary distribution and monitoring. PeopleDAO Anniversary and general Design Team discretionary funding will only be granted for unanticipated but essential DAO design requirements.

With these, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 3.
Thank you, and Long Live PeopleDAO!

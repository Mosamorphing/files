# PIP8: The PeopleDAO Constitution Version 1.0

A constitution dictates the governance and structure of an organization and is the foundation for all further policies and procedures. A constitution provides stability, order, and direction. Ratifying a constitution is likely the most important milestone for a DAO.

The Legal Team produced the PeopleDAO Constitution v1.0, integrating feedback from weekly meetings and written public comment. The document covers policies related to:

1. Multig treasury, including the election process
2. Structuring the DAO into Teams
3. Code of conduct for members
4. SubDAOs
5. Glossary of terms

The document is not final and will be iterated upon over time.

Vote Yes to ratify and No to reject.

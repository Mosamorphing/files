The account team accomplished a great deal in the recently concluded season 2 from the accounting tool tutorials to the tracking of contributors and rewards. In season 3, the account team will primarily focus on the DAO accounting and improve its analytics to shed more light on the spending ratio, inflow plus outflow, infographic, and monthly summary that'll include the top contributors and the total number of contributors each month.

In the future, the account team will improve its monitoring and payout system by establishing a squad called policing, whose members will be assigned to each team and every task that's been completed on the team, and who will then observe/help fill the spreadsheet closely to prevent future address errors, double reward payouts, overpayment, and underpayment. This is intended to limit the number of complaints filed after payouts.

Every DAO should have a subunit dedicated to improving governance and organizational policies. The major accomplishment of the Legal Team in Season 1 was to research and produce the PeopleDAO Constitution v1.0. The team has set the following goals for PeopleDAO Season 2:

Amend the Constitution -- Both our DAO and web3 are evolving at an accelerated rate. Our Constitution needs to keep pace with this growth. The Legal Team will lead an amendment process this season, beginning with public commentary and engaging topics such as improving governance and formalizing new teams. Amendments will ensure our Constitution remains a source of stability with its set of clear policies.

Report on DAO legal wrappers -- The regulatory environment around DAOs is shifting and new cases are being brought to court, which may have implications for DAOs and liability. Being unincorporated does not necessarily shield PeopleDAO from liability or taxation. The Legal Team commits to assembling a short report comparing different legal wrappers for DAOs, drawn from expert opinion.

Conflict Mediation Workshops - Disputes, disagreements, and conflicts occur in all types of human relationships, across all dimensions and civilizations. Mediation is an important and fruitful strategy for the prevention of conflict and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The Legal Team plans on organizing two virtual workshops that will pin-point the common sources of conflict and dispute in DAOs and also highlight the best ways to de-escalate and resolve these conflicts.

Additionally, the Legal Team is asking for some discretionary funds in case any other pressing tasks appear, such as impromptu conflict mediation, or writing educational articles in collaboration with the Writer Team.

The Legal Team has assembled the following budget:  
Amendment Process = 20,000 PEOPLE  
Legal Wrapper Report = 15,000 PEOPLE  
Conflict Mediation Workshops = 10,000 PEOPLE  
Discretionary Funding = 20,000 PEOPLE

Total = 65,000

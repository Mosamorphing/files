Author: 0xAA#2040  
Proposal Synopsis: Create a DAO governed by PEOPLE token, by the name of PeopleDAO.  
Required Quorum: 500M $PEOPLE (10% of circulation supply on Ethereum)  
Vote Duration: 7 days

Proposal Details:  
After failing to win the auction for a rare copy of the US Constitution, ConstitutionDAO announced to shut the group down.  
But We The People of Web3.0 are not defeated. We decided to establish a DAO that governed by $PEOPLE token, by the name of PeopleDAO.  
PeopleDAO differs from the previous ConstitutionDAO in three major ways.

1. People token has never been governance of ConstitutionDAO. While PEOPLE token is the governance token of PeopleDAO.
2. The decision-making of ConstitutionDAO is performed by a small group of people in the core team, i.e. determining the refund strategy. While PeopleDAO has no core team, and every proposal needs to be voted with PEOPLE token.
3. Constitution DAO aims to purchase and manage a rare copy of the US Constitution. While PeopleDAO is a meta DAO that governs a group of DAOs, which maximize the interests of $PEOPLE holders.

WE THE PEOPLE of Web3.0, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this PeopleDAO.  
DAO of the $people, by the $people, for the $people.

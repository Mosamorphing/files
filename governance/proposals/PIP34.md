The Incubator Team forges ahead into the lifting market, nearing launch for all its projects: Perpex, Soulbound Protocol, Afro Piece, and Journey Owaa. We continue to reflect and iterate on our program, looking for efficiencies and how to increase our development output.

We have the following goals for this quarter:

- Publish details about version 3 of the incubator program. The team has already conducted the evaluation and written the report. We’re finalizing the design.
- We expect all our projects to launch by the end of this season, or in the beginning of the next. Each integrates the $PEOPLE token, providing the token utility. We are excited to finish up testing and development with our product teams, and contribute advising and reach to their marketing. Our budget will support incubator stewards and use discretionary funds to cushion any unexpected project costs.

We are requesting to roll over funds from last season (93,000 $PEOPLE) to staff project managers and support planning with discretionary funds. Our team asks for an additional 27,000 $PEOPLE. The total represents a 29% reduction from last season's budget, in recognition of market conditions and the need to be fiscally responsible.

Breakdown of the Season 4 budget:
Total = 120,000 $PEOPLE

Reviewing Incubator Applications = 8,000 $PEOPLE (6.7%)  
Steward Salaries = 60,000 $PEOPLE (50%)  
Evaluation Report = 5,000 $PEOPLE (4.2%)  
Operational Costs = 2,000 $PEOPLE (1.7%)  
Discretionary Funds = 45,000 $PEOPLE (37.5%)

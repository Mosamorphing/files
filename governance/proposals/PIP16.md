Developer is an important team in PeopleDAO, and every Season we have some goals to execute. A few of the more important goals

1. Continuously update and iterate on our website to keep it up to date and active. To this end, our key team member прыетранкаOG#4845 has been acting as an Owner of the Website, suggesting many directions for updates and optimizations. Let's look forward to the implementation and completion of these features together.
2. Incubating SubDAO has been an important mission and revenue source for PeopleDAO. We have incubated many important SubDAOs, such as PandaDAO, LanguageDAO. The Developer Team can provide important development capabilities for SubDAOs that are still in their initial stages. Development capability is the most needed capability in the beginning stage. In order to motivate the developers to contribute continuously and give them reasonable rewards, we also allocate a significant budget for the launch of SubDAO.
3. DAO Info aggregator. In 2022 DAO governance model organizations are spurting out, and PeopleDAO is the inheritor of the DAO philosophy. we are considering aggregating important DAO information and making a website to bring together the DAO information you want.
4. We have removed the budget allocation for the Active member of Coordinape. We believe that for Developers, "Talk is cheap, show me the code". We encourage people to contribute more and submit code.
5. Discretionary funds only, for flexibility. (NOT ALL WILL BE USED) Other dev needs that arise that are not included in the tasks above will belong to this budget, such as devs assists for Incubation projects, data collection job, initial website creation, etc.

开发者是 PeopleDAO 的一个重要团队，每个赛季我们都有一些目标要执行。下个季度几个比较重要的目标

1. 不断地更新和迭代我们的网站，使其保持最新和活跃。为此，我们的主要团队成员 прыетранкаOG#4845 一直扮演着网站主人的角色，提出了许多更新和优化的方向。让我们一起期待着这些功能的实施和完成。
2. 孵化 SubDAO 一直是 PeopleDAO 的一个重要任务和收入来源。我们已经孵化了许多重要的 SubDAO，如 PandaDAO，LanguageDAO。 开发者团队可以为仍处于初始阶段的 SubDAO 提供重要的开发能力。开发能力是初始阶段最需要的能力。为了激励开发者不断做出贡献并给予他们合理的奖励，我们还为 SubDAO 的启动分配了大量预算。
3. DAO 信息聚合器。在 2022 年的 DAO 治理模式中，各种组织如雨后春笋般涌现，PeopleDAO 是 DAO 理念的继承者。我们考虑将重要的 DAO 信息聚合起来，做一个网站，汇集大家想要的 DAO 信息。
4. 我们取消了对 Coordinape 活跃成员的预算分配。我们认为，对于开发者来说，"空谈误国，实干兴邦"。我们鼓励大家多做贡献，提交代码。
5. 用于自由支配的资金，以获得灵活性。(不会全部使用)其他不包括在上述任务中的开发需求将属于这个预算，例如孵化项目的开发协助，数据收集工作，初始网站创建等。

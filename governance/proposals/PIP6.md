# PIP6: Incubator Proposal for Docu-Series and Pilanthropic NFTs

PeopleDAO member Existential Zoomer is proposing a community project to raise awareness about human trafficking in Nigeria and bring direct aid to victims. The project consists of a video docu-series and philanthropic NFT collection, developed in collaboration with DAO members Matter Turbulent, 0xAA, and Y4000. We ask the PeopleDAO community to approve coldstart funding worth approximately $7700 USD to launch the project titled The Lost Children of Benin City.

Coldstart funding will support Existential Zoomer traveling to Benin City, conducting interviews and background research for the project, as well as producing some visual assets in the form of photographic and video content. As a deliverable, Zoomer will produce a multimedia article showcasing her research and building support for additional fundraising. The visual assets can inspire creative development of the NFT collection.

In terms of financial sustainability, the forthcoming NFT collection and video streaming fees will both act as forms of revenue. We plan to explore multiple funding sources to fund the broader docu-series, including Gitcoin, CultDAO, and PeopleDAO.

This project would count as one of the first docu-series launched and financed by a DAO and web3 mechanisms. Using an NFT collection both as a fundraiser and a vehicle for philanthropy makes the effort even more innovative.

Here is a message from Existential Zoomer about what the initiative means to her: “This project is dedicated to all the ones we’ve lost, the ones who will never be found and the untold stories, and to the ones we have found but who are scarred and will never be whole again.”

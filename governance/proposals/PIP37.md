During the just concluded season, the account team implemented the accountant role where some account team members were assigned to a team to help make financing easy for each team and the team lead, so far it’s been a success. It has helped in ways like the spreadsheet filling for the month's payout and funds breakdown, guiding every team lead and members to know what’s left and how to better navigate forward.

The Account team also had info graphics and continued its monthly summary report on its Notion page which is completely accessible to all of our members. The second seasonal accounting report is also ready and it includes:

- Contributor growth
- Treasury assets
- The info graphics for the season
- Problems encountered with reward payout
- Improvised solutions
- Inflow & Outflow
- A link to our monthly summaries

Now, for the new season, the Account team will continue doing everything that has been mentioned, the Account team will also work on providing more analysis on each team and the DAO’s expenditure. We will work closely with the incubator team to help on risk management and financial related issues, Account team will also work closely with Dev team to build the custom tool needed to better enhance accounting and multisig signers speed at attending to transactions.

Funding requested for Season 4: 106,000 $PEOPLE token

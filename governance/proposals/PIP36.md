During Season 3, the Design Team started with the implementation and task assignments for the new job roles, namely, the Co-lead and the POAP Assistant. This allowed for more effective task handling and delegation. Throughout the season, the team focused on the completion of the DAO’s website through the help of the Dev Team. Relevant website pages such as the Team Profiles and Incubated Project Profiles were added to showcase more information about the DAO. Social media posts that were released were monitored to ensure that they follow the established brand guidelines.

Now that the Design Team has fairly made consistent imagery through our rebranding, hence, our main goal for this season – to continue to prepare for and produce quality design needs that may arise during the season. This includes the creation of content-filled social media releases such as twitter posts that are relevant, necessary, timely, and are grounded on the DAO’s core values and objectives.

Recognition of meaningful DAO contributors will be continued through the current POAP reward system, not only by personally awarding the POAPs to the nominees, but also through the release of a publicity material to foster and encourage the People to significant participation. Likewise, quality POAPs will be provided for PeopleDAO event attendees. Discretionary funds will only be allotted for necessary design needs that may arise, otherwise specifically indicated and identified prior to the start of the season.

With these, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 4.  
Thank you, and Long Live PeopleDAO!

Budget: 77,500 $PEOPLE Tokens

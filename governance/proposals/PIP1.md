Core Proposal PIP1 - Founding Voter POAP

Authors: MatterTurbulent#5161 and Steakr#8817  
Proposal Synopsis: Gift a POAP to wallets who voted Yes to form People DAO in the PIP0  
Required Quorum: 322.43m $PEOPLE (a majority of the amount that voted Yes to create People DAO)  
Vote Duration: 5 days

Proposal Details: People DAO was officially established on December 6th when the PIP0 vote closed, with Yes garnering 99.8% of the vote. We propose all wallets who voted Yes should receive a POAP as a token of appreciation, and to commemorate the founding of People DAO.

POAP, which stands for Proof of Attendance Protocol, offers a record of life experiences. The protocol issues POAPs, which are non-fungible tokens tied to an image, similar in principle to an IRL badge or pin. They can be kept as mementos, used to access privileges or activities, or sold in secondary markets like OpenSea.

POAPs are issued on an Ethereum sidechain called xDAI. The costs are covered by the protocol, so minting is free to both issuers and users. POAPs can be migrated from xDAI to Ethereum mainnet but that does require paying gas fees. Learn more about POAPs here: https://poap.xyz/faqs

People DAO contributor Steakr made a design for the Founding Voter POAP, in discussion with another DAO member, Matter. The design has received support from the community, as voiced on Twitter and the Discord. View the design here: https://twitter.com/The_PeopleDAO/status/1472640551350460418?s=20

Vote Yes to support the distribution of the Founding Voter POAP to eligible wallets. Vote No if you don't want People DAO to provide this POAP.

# PIP30: Buy The Fucking Constitution: PeopleDAO’s Commitment Towards Our Fundraiser

Author: Tet#7609

Dear $PEOPLE,

November 2021 was a landmark moment in web3 history, it was the start of ConstitutionDAO who rallied people across the global in an effort to buy the a private copy of the US Constitution that was up for auction by Sotheby’s. Although the effort ended in vain as we were outbid by Ken Griffin, a second chance has emerged for web3 to take another shot at buying a second copy of the US Constitution, hosted by Sorheby’s, again.

PeopleDAO is one of the main organisers for this year’s auction fundraiser, working closely with our partners from JuiceboxDAO, the Aztec Network, and Nucleo. As one of the key organisers, we wish to spearhead the fundraising initiative by allocating $10,000 US Dollars towards the fundraiser pool in the name of the PeopleDAO Community. With this, the community will also hold a stake in the governance of the Constitution document, under the pretext that we win the auction.

Similar to the original ConstitutionDAO fundraiser via the Juicebox Protocol, donated funds can be refunded via the fundraiser smart contract if we were to fail in the bidding for the Constitution document. Therefore, we would like to inform the members of the community that fail safes are in place and these $10,000 donated funds will not be made redundant in the event of an auction bidding failure.

Without further ado, we would like to hear the voices of the community. Are you in support of us contributing $10,000 US Dollars to the fundraiser initiative to once again have a chance in bidding for the US Constitution hosted by Sotheby’s on 13th December 2022? Voice out your choice, vote now.

Choice 1: Approve the fund contribution.  
Choice 2: Deny the fund contribution.

2021 年 11 月是 Web3 历史上具有里程碑意义的时刻，这是 ConstitutionDAO 的开始，它在全球范围内召集人们努力购买即将由苏富比拍卖的美国宪法的私人副本。虽然我们的努力以 Ken Griffin 的出价而告终，但 Web3 仍然有机会再次尝试购买由苏富比主办的美国宪法的第二份副本。

作为主要组织者之一，我们希望以 PeopleDAO 社区的名义向筹款池拨出 10,000 美元，作为筹款倡议的先锋。有了这个，社区也将在宪法文件的治理中占有一席之地，前提是我们赢得了拍卖。

与通过 Juicebox 协议进行的原始 ConstitutionDAO 筹款活动类似，如果我们未能竞标宪法文件，捐赠的资金可以通过筹款活动的智能合约退还。因此，我们想告知社区成员，失败的安全险已就位，如果拍卖失败，这 10,000 美元的捐赠资金将不会失去。

事不宜迟，我们想听听社区的声音。您是否支持我们向筹款活动捐赠 10,000 美元，以再次有机会竞标苏富比于 2022 年 12 月 13 日举办的美国宪法拍卖？为您的选择发声，现在投票吧。

选择一：批准资金拨款。  
选择二：拒绝资金拨款。

### Candidate nominations

#### Mosa

Gm, gm. You can call me Mosa. I'm from Nigeria with timezone UTC+1. I've been an active member of PeopleDAO since 2022 and I've taken up different responsibilities over time, mostly around operations and accelerating incubated projects, such as; JourneyOwaa, ForThePeople and WAGBTC.

I'm interested in this role to safeguard PeopleDAO treasury and foster smoother operations. I have an eye for detail and a good work ethic, a good addition to the team.

Although I've not held owner/signer role before, I'm familiar with Safe, OnChainDen, and the fundamentals of multisig governorship. Iâ€™ve also co-written a body of work on multisig governance and optimization.

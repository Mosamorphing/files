## Description

Following the treasury incident, an opportunity has arised to rebuild the PeopleDAO’s internal processes. We would like to review learnings from other DAOs - one of these is MoonDAO’s transition from guild-based structure to project-based structure ([reference](https://twitter.com/LarrotizPablo/status/1638671447739760641)), which has also been adopted by other DAOs.

During the first year of PeopleDAO’s existence, many different activities across the DAO and incubator/accelerator have been supported, however the organization has struggled to measure its impact and to provide significant return of investments. Moving forward, we believe that with the limited remaining resources, the DAO should focus on these two objectives, and the project-based structure greatly compliments this desire.

### Areas of improvement

#### Team composition

- Before:
  - Teams often consisting of large amount of low-context people with different levels of engagement and commitment for tasks
  - Lack of strong entry criteria to join a team
- After:
  - Small teams built specifically for the given task
  - Proven track-record and objective focus as requirement for joining a team

#### Task definition and evaluation

- Before:
  - Tasks defined during seasonal planning with minimal focus on evaluation and implementation of key performance indicators
  - Seasonal planning could result in evaluation loop being too long and ineffective
  - Unknown impact of individual tasks and teams on the growth and return of investments for the DAO
- After:
  - Tasks defined with objectively measurable objectives as a requirement
  - Task completion followed by evaluation as a condition for acceptance of other related tasks
  - Evaluation loop shortened directly to the duration of the specific task
  - Direct measurability of impact on DAO’s investments and growth

#### Personal member progression

- Before:
  - Sometimes slow personal progression inside individual teams
  - No defined procedures for rotation of team’s leadership
  - Lack of personal performance tracking in the DAO
- After:
  - Ability to join different teams at various different positions in shorter period of time
  - Opportunity for more inexperienced members to join low-impact/low-risk tasks as project leaders
  - Tracking of personal performance based on evaluation of individual tasks

### Implementation

- The Operations Team will remain the only general-purpose team in the DAO
  - The team is responsible for DAO's upkeeping and governance-related activities, such as accounting, elections and similar
  - Membership in the team is subject to approval by DAO administrators and is evaluated on case by case basis according to the DAO's needs
- A community member or group of members can become a self-assigned project lead by defining a project
  - Projects are required to provide a clearly defined objectives and tasks, which have measurable indicators of completion, both in the personal and DAO-wide context
  - Projects are required to provide a detailed breakdown of requested funds, including all spending items and member rewards
  - Projects are required to seek and produce revenue-generating outcomes
  - Project leads are required to assemble the project team from active contributors with proven track record in relevant area in order to maximalize the possibility of successful completion of the project
  - All of above is a requirement for project proposal submission
- DAO administrators are responsible for approving or denying project proposals
  - Administrators are obliged to evaluate only proposals which have provided all required information (see above)
  - Administrators are allowed to approve only proposals which produce revenue or other clearly defined means of positive return on investment for the DAO

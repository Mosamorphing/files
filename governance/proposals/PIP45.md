## Description

Preceding the PeopleDAO’s Multisig Governor Election, based on the experience with the current multisig setup and knowledge gained through outside research, the following updates to PeopleDAO’s multisig setup are proposed:

#### Change role term to 6 months

Previously, the DAO has seen significant activity drop-offs over time from governors, resulting in transactions and actions taking days for confirmation and execution. In an effort to tackle this role exhaustion and improve overall effectivity, a reduced term is proposed. This is in line with the general sentiment expressed in previous proposals, which did not reach the required participation quorum. Additionally, performance of individual governors and the whole team will be closely monitored with an objective of further improvements in the future.

#### Change confirmation threshold and governor team to 4/6 configuration

A smaller team will enable a closer cooperation and faster execution of the multisig, supporting the issue of degraded performance mentioned in the previous point. Given the value of PeopleDAO’s treasury, the current configuration is to be considered oversized. This updated configuration provides a similar level of security as the current setup.

#### Change role reward to 50 USD in PEOPLE equivalent

During the current governor team’s term, the reward of 1000 PEOPLE per month equaled to roughly 8 to 31 USD, depending on the token market price. Reward definition in USD with payouts in PEOPLE token equivalent at the moment of accounting counters the aspects of the token volatility, and provides a fair reward for the duties performed in the multisig governor role. Assuming the update of the governor team size, this will not have a significant effect on the total expenses dedicated to the management of the DAO’s multisig.

PeopleDAO AFRO PIECE is all about African culture and history. This NFT project is a medium to showcase Africa’s art and history behind them, telling most of the forgotten stories and events that took place years ago. Our mission is to empower web3 revolution in Africa through spreading the beauty of its culture in the form of an NFT collection. The world can have a chance to explore the beautiful ancient art & African history. Therefore, this community project can possibly raise awareness for the continent as well as the PeopleDAO ecosystem. There are some cultural aspects that we can possibly design about such as the Argungu fishing festival.

We would like to request funding of 200,000 $PEOPLE (~$7,450 - $PEOPLE’s current price = $0.037). AFRO PIECE PeopleDAO will utilize this grant funding to complete deep research into the culture and history of Africa before the end of August, paying artists for designing, developing websites for NFT showcases as well as marketing and social media influencers. We plan to launch this NFT collection before the end of 2022. The detailed breakdown are as follow:

Research = 10,000 $PEOPLE  
Consultation = 20,000 $PEOPLE  
IRL Outreach to Museum and Art Galleries = 12,000 $PEOPLE  
Design = 120,000 $PEOPLE  
Marketing = 38,000 $PEOPLE  
Grand total = 200,000 $PEOPLE

Regarding the contribution to the ecosystem, 50% of total sales from the mint phase will be used to purchase $PEOPLE and then be delegated back to the PeopleDAO treasury. Moreover, the team decided to issue about 1,499 NFTs designed in the collection, in which 150 whitelist NFTs spots will be allocated for C-FRAC NFT owners and 200 general whitelist spots for people holding 1,500 people tokens. People in the whitelist spot are able to mint one NFT for half the sale price. Furthermore, we will also allocate about 10 free-minted NFTs for PeopleDAO core contributors and 20 NFTs for giveaway campaigns for the project marketing. The remaining 1,199 NFTs will be put on market sales. These incentives would encourage people to learn and hold $PEOPLE tokens if they want to purchase NFTs at a discount. Moreover, the project also aims to empower and bring more awareness to the PeopleDAO African community as well as the People DAO ecosystem. AFRO PIECE will be massively marketed on PeopleDAO Africa Twitter with the support from PeopleDAO marketing team.
